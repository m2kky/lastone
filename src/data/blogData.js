    title: 'Picking Your AI Powerhouse: A Guide to LLMs, Reasoning Models and Research Agents',
    excerpt: 'With so many AI model options available today, it can be hard to know which one is the best fit for your startup or project.',

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>With so many AI model options available today, it can be hard to know which one is the best fit for your startup or project. Broad "flagship" large language models (LLMs) excel at general-purpose tasks, reasoning models shine when you need transparent, step-by-step logic, and research agents automate end-to-end information gathering and analysis.</p>
      
      <h2>Overview of Model Categories</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flagship LLMs</strong> — Pre-trained, general-purpose language models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasoning Models</strong> — Variants of LLMs optimised for explicit chain-of-thought reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Research Agents</strong> — Agent frameworks that automate multi-step research workflows.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>When to Choose a Flagship LLM</h2>
      <h3>Use Cases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Creative content generation (blogs, social posts, ad copy)</li>
        <li>Conversational interfaces and customer support bots</li>
        <li>Simple transformations (translation, paraphrasing, summarisation)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>When to Choose a Reasoning Model</h2>
      <h3>Use Cases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Multi-step logic or math problems</li>
        <li>Structured plans or decision trees</li>
        <li>Legal or academic text analysis with transparent reasoning</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Choosing between a flagship LLM, a reasoning model, or a research agent boils down to task complexity and workflow. Start with a general LLM for speed, move to a reasoning model for transparent multi-step logic, and build a research agent to automate end-to-end information workflows.</p>
