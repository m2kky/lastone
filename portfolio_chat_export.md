# Portfolio Development Chat Export

## Project Overview
Building a portfolio website with specific animations and sections using React.js and GSAP.

## Key Requirements

### Hero Section
- Full-screen video background (`herovid.mp4` from `@video/`)
- Signature image (`@sig.png`) appearing with reveal effect after 0.5 seconds, centered
- Three words ("CREATE - AUTOMATE - GROW") appearing sequentially with glitch effect, taking 2 seconds total
- After words, first signature blurs and transitions to second signature (`@sig2.png`)
- Simultaneously, phrase "Create, Automate and grow" appears below signature with typing effect
- Scrolling disabled until all animations complete
- Signature and final phrase larger and positioned correctly on mobile
- True glitch effect (not just text disappearing/appearing)
- Final phrase on single line with shadow on mobile
- Final phrase larger on desktop

### About Section
- Appears with animation linked to Hero section
- **Mobile Animation:**
  - When scrolling starts after Hero, About section slides horizontally from right, pushing Hero left
  - Portrait image (`@mekky_about.png`) enters from far right, settles center
  - Circle with color `#EB5E28` enters with image, settles behind it
  - Main title appears word by word below image as user scrolls
  - Once title fully displayed, image and title rise upwards (later removed per user feedback)
  - Body text (three paragraphs) appears word by word with scrolling
  - Two buttons ("View Projects", "Get In touch") appear with scrolling
  - Entire About section "pinned" during animations
  - Portrait image remains fixed after initial entry
  - Body text larger
  - Main title with proper letter and word spacing
  - Specific words ("AUTOMATION", "TRAINER") colored `#EB5E28`, left-aligned
  - Body text as three distinct paragraphs
  - Buttons rounded with small arrow moving inside circle on hover/click, glow effect on hover
  - Primary button glow orange, ghost button glow white
  - No purple glow on primary button hover

### Services Section
- **Mobile Version First:**
  - List of services with icons, titles, expandable points
  - Service title changes color to `#EB5E28` on hover or when card open
  - No border/outline around service card, only separator line between services
  - Section title "What I can do for you?"
  - Words "do" and "you" in title highlighted with underline on hover
  - Custom SVG icons instead of emojis
- **Content:**
  1. AI & AUTOMATION: Designing custom automations...
  2. DIGITAL MARKETING: Executing targeted ad campaigns...
  3. WEB DESIGN: Designing clean, responsive websites...
  4. COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT: Building and nurturing engaged online communities...
  5. TEAM ENABLEMENT & WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION: Setting up efficient systems and tools...
- **Statistics Block:**
  - Years of Experience: +7
  - Completed Projects: +84
  - Clients on Worldwide: 50+
  - People Impacted: +500

### Timeline Section
- **Mobile Version First:**
  - Vertical timeline with years
  - Each event card has:
    - Year (color `#EB5E28`, bold, no background/box)
    - Blurred image (temporary: `public/images/Timeline/{2003,2016,2022}.jpg`)
    - Event title (e.g., "IGCSE Graduation")
    - Place (e.g., "Jeddah")
    - Small details
  - Year positioned above image
  - Event title partially overlaps top of image
  - Image size fixed at 370x230px, maintaining quality
  - Only 3 events displayed initially
  - Fade/gradient effect at bottom covering last event
  - "SEE FULL TIMELINE" button with hover effect (underline and arrow slide) using color `#EB5E28`
  - Section title: "From humble" (Extra Bold) and "beginnings" (italic bold), left-aligned, at very top
  - Timeline line starts from first circle
  - Title and subtitle positioned above timeline line

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- React.js for component-based UI
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for advanced animations
- Vite for build tooling

### Key GSAP Features Used
- `gsap.timeline()`: Orchestrating sequential and overlapping animations
- `ScrollTrigger`: Linking animations to scroll position, pinning elements
- `TextPlugin`: Animating text (typing effect)
- `gsap.set()`: Setting initial CSS properties
- `gsap.to()`, `gsap.fromTo()`: Animating properties
- `eventCallback("onComplete")`: Triggering functions after timeline completion
- `gsap.context()`: Managing GSAP instances for component lifecycle

### CSS Techniques
- Responsive design using `@media`, `clamp()`, `vw`, `vh`
- Custom properties (`--hlw`, `--hlp`)
- Pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`)
- `object-fit`, `overflow-x: hidden`, `text-shadow`, `white-space: nowrap`
- `mix-blend-mode`, `filter: blur()`, `linear-gradient`
- `position: fixed`, `absolute`, `relative`, `grid`, `flexbox`
- `transform: translate()`, `xPercent`, `yPercent`

### Component Architecture
- `Hero.jsx` - Hero section with video background and signature animations
- `About.jsx` - About section with horizontal slide and content reveal
- `ServicesSection.jsx` - Services list with expandable cards and statistics
- `TimelineSection.jsx` - Timeline with events and images

## Key Animations Implemented

### Hero Section Animations
1. Signature reveal after 0.5s delay
2. Sequential glitch effect for three words (CREATE, AUTOMATE, GROW)
3. Signature blur and swap to second image
4. Typing effect for final phrase
5. Scroll unlock after all animations complete

### About Section Animations
1. Horizontal slide-in from right, pushing hero left
2. Portrait and circle entry from far right
3. Word-by-word title reveal with scrolling
4. Sequential body paragraph typing
5. Button appearance with scrolling
6. Section pinning during animations

### Services Section Animations
1. Staggered entry for header, subtitle, and cards
2. Statistics block fade-in
3. Card expand/collapse with hover effects
4. Title color change on hover/open

### Timeline Section Animations
1. Timeline line positioning from first circle
2. Event card layout with overlapping elements
3. CTA button hover effects with underline and arrow movement

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Desktop and mobile specific adjustments
- Proper scaling using `clamp()` functions
- Overflow handling to prevent horizontal scroll

## Color Scheme
- Primary accent: `#EB5E28` (orange)
- Background: `#0b0b0b` (dark)
- Text: `#efeeea` (light)
- Secondary elements: Various opacity levels

## User Feedback and Iterations
- Fixed signature image paths
- Improved glitch effect implementation
- Adjusted mobile spacing and sizing
- Enhanced button animations
- Refined timeline positioning
- Optimized responsive layouts

## Final Status
All four sections completed with:
- ✅ Hero section with video background and signature animations
- ✅ About section with horizontal slide and content reveal
- ✅ Services section with expandable cards and statistics
- ✅ Timeline section with events and proper positioning

The portfolio is fully functional with smooth animations, responsive design, and proper mobile/desktop optimization.
